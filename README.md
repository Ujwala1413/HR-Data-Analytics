# HR DATA ANALYSIS

## Problem Statement
The company is experiencing a high employee attrition rate of 16.12%, leading to significant turnover costs and disruptions in business operations. 
This HR analytics project aims to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition by analyzing various demographic, educational, and job-related data points. 
The goal is to provide actionable insights to reduce turnover and improve job satisfaction across the organization.

## Key Questions to Address:
1. Which departments and job roles have the highest attrition rates, and what patterns can be observed across different age groups?
2. How does educational background influence attrition, and are employees with certain qualifications more likely to leave?
3. Is there a correlation between marital status and employee retention?
4. What trends can be identified in gender-based attrition, and how does it impact overall workforce diversity?
5. How can the company improve job satisfaction, which currently stands at 2.6 out of 5?

## Key Insights
### 1. Overall Attrition Rate (16.12%)
The company has a relatively high attrition rate of 16.12%, which signals a pressing need to investigate underlying causes, such as job satisfaction, currently rated at 2.6/5. 
Addressing this issue can improve retention and reduce costs.

### 2. Attrition by Education Level
Employees with Bachelor’s degrees have the highest attrition (99 individuals), indicating possible dissatisfaction with career development or job roles. 
Master's degree holders also have a notable attrition count (58), suggesting room for improvement in employee engagement.

### 3. Attrition by Job Role
Managers (62) and Sales Executives (57) experience the highest attrition, highlighting significant challenges in these roles, possibly due to job stress or unmet career expectations. 
This suggests the need for improved leadership training and support.

### 4. Attrition by Age Group
The 25-34 age group shows the highest attrition (112 individuals), followed by 35-44 (51 individuals), indicating that younger employees are more likely to leave, likely in search of better opportunities. 
Retention strategies should focus on career growth for younger staff.

### 5. Gender Distribution of Employees
Male employees (882) outnumber female employees (588), but the dashboard does not show significant gender-based attrition differences. 
This could indicate gender balance in retention but further analysis may be required.

### 6. Attrition by Marital Status
Married employees have the highest attrition rate (45.78%), followed by single employees (31.97%). 
This suggests the need for work-life balance programs or family-friendly policies to retain married staff.

### 7. Department-wise Attrition
The Sales department accounts for 56.12% of total attrition, followed by R&D (38.82%) and HR (5.06%), suggesting that sales-specific issues like targets or compensation may drive turnover. 
A closer look at departmental policies is required to address this.
